Here I've created a linked list with 5 nodes and node 5 is connected with node 2 which forms a cycle in a linked list.
I've used the TORTOISE & HARE algorithm which had been explained in the session.
Hasing algorithmcan also be used here ...where we could have managed the memory or node instead of the element present in that memory address bcuz there might have chances that elememt could have changed.
