When processItem(item1) is called:

It checks isProcessing (at Point A). It's false, so it proceeds.

It immediately sets isProcessing = true; (at Point B). The "busy" sign is now ON.

It then hits await someAsyncOperation(item1); (at Point C). The execution of this specific processItem(item1) function pauses here, waiting for someAsyncOperation to finish. BUT, the isProcessing flag REMAINS true during this entire waiting period.

When processItem(item2) is called rapidly (while item1 is still at Point C):

It immediately checks if (isProcessing) (at Point A).

Because processItem(item1) set isProcessing to true and hasn't set it back to false yet, this condition evaluates to true.

The return; statement is executed. processItem(item2) stops right there. It never reaches isProcessing = true; or await someAsyncOperation(item2);.
